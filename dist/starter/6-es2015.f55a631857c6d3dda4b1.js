Keep in mind, though, that a "children\'s curriculum" is typically so watered down that the child may have a difficult time transitioning into the "adult curriculum" at that school when they are old enough to do so, and may end up having to start over. Also, you should be allowed to watch a class in progress. If you are not permitted to watch a class while it is being conducted, then you can only assume that the instructor has something to hide, and that school must be avoided.

Such practice promotes commercialism and makes the Arts less than what they are. The emphasis of the school should be on teaching the student well, instructor performance, and on the true purpose of the martial arts, which is self defense and self cultivation. All other activities and training should be \"icing on the cake\", and while a lot of fun, should not be the main focus. Also, avoid schools that are so violent in their training that the students are being severely injured (i.e., broken bones or head trauma). It is not necessary to injure a student in order to teach them good martial arts skills.

You can also expect to go home tired and invigorated after every class. As far as what you will actually learn? That depends upon what system you are training in. For example, if you were training with me in Kenpo, your average training would consist of drilling basics (the building blocks of all martial arts, and a necessary component for developing a solid martial arts base), training with striking bags, mats, and the wooden stakes (needed to develop proper strike motion, power, and accuracy, and for the wooden stakes, also called the wooden dummy, to develop continuity in motion), learning forms (defensive movements done in a consistant dance-like motion to simulate multiple attackers or to teach an important defensive principle), techniques (movements done to teach one important defensive tactic), and contact training (the execution of defensive movements done with a training partner, which assists in developing proper strike placement and body manipulation). Each of these would then be broken down, depending upon what I wanted you to achieve. Then we would go over combat mindset, tactical mindset, and other subjects to help prepare you for the inevitablity of a physical altercation. Of course, all of this would be over a matter of years, not in just one class. Are all studios like this? No!

Having said that, I will also say that I personally see contracts as a form of strong arming money from a student. For a while I used enrollment agreements, but I soon discovered that they had no bearing on the consistency of a students attendance (the excuse that is generally used to explain the use of contracts). Most studios typically offer enrollment on a 1 or 2 year program, and will also use enrollment agreements. If you look hard, however, you might find a studio that still does it the old way, without contracts. It shouldn\'t matter, really. To train properly requires years of commitment, and due to this a contract will only be a problem if you are a quitter. Any good school will let you out of a contract if you have to move, and will give you a leave of absence should you need to stop for a while due to personal problems. Test fees, also known as "Graduation Tuition", are usually applied only when the student tests for his/her next belt level, and is one of those funky martial arts business things. You will be told that the "Graduation Tuition" is used to cover the cost of the belt test and certification. Don\'t be fooled, the cost of a colored belt is about 5 bucks, and the certificate costs about the same (excepting black belt certificates, which truly are very, very expensive). No, the test fee is simply extra income for the studio or association that issues the belt certificate. No matter, most studios have test fees, so there is no getting away from them.

I just wish they would be up front about it. Just make sure you get a certificate for every belt you earn, and that it is signed by at least three black belts. Concerning introductory programs: A quality school should offer an introductory program for the prospective student to see if he/she likes the system, the instructor, and the school. Make sure that this "intro" offer is not binding in any way, and if at all possible try to get an introductory course that lasts at least 6 weeks, so that you can truly evaluate the studio, instructor(s), and the system.
