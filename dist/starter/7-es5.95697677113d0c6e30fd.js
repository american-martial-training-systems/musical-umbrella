But that was not all. During my time with the Conways, I was also extensively trained in ground fighting and grappling, as Sifu John was a Judo instructor long before he began training with Ed Parker in Kenpo, and Sifu Johnny was a ground fighting wizard. Sifu Johnny's ability to logically combine ground fighting with Kenpo was extremely progressive (ahead of it's time, in fact, as it was shunned by many as not traditional),and my early years of training up to and through my black belt included both Kenpo and groundfighting.

During that time I worked very closely with one of my own Kenpo black belts, Stephen Souza, who was not only trained by Sifu Johnny in Judo techniques, but also very experienced in wrestling. Together we formed a complimentary ground fighting style to go with the exceptional art of Kenpo. We did not, however, combine the two styles, preferring instead to not sacrifice the integrity of Kenpo by watering it down with other systems. So instead of combining the two styles, we chose for the belt tests to incorporate both, but the techniques of each system remained distinctly separate.

Whatever the reason, the fact is we are an armed society, the bad guys carry firearms, and we as martial arts instructors have a responsibility to be trained in the proper care and use of these weapons, so that we can train our students.

Even more so, however, is the assembly line approach to martial arts instruction that has developed within the western culture over the last 50 years. No two students are exactly alike, so how can they be taught in exactly the same manner? Add to this the general belief that rank advancement and comfortable situations is the only way to retain students, and you end up with what is currently occurring: Instructors mostly ignoring any type of mindset instruction, casually teaching basics only from the perspective of getting the student on to more interesting martial arts techniques, then advancing the student so rapidly through the belt system they never have the opportunity to perfect their martial arts foundation. The end result being a large majority of black belts that are supposed to be experts, have the knowledge of an expert, but have yet to develop fully as a cultivated, capable, and competent martial artist. Conversely, when a martial arts student takes his time, learns his basics, develops proper mindset, and works his way through the curriculum with the desire to perfect as much as possible that which he learns, he becomes a much better martial artist at a much earlier stage than if he rushes through the belt system just to have that ultimate martial arts status symbol - black belt.
